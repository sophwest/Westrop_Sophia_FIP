# pvcjunkie.com - A place to share my love for collecting
"pvcjunkie is a website dedicated to my hobby and love for collecting anime figures and merchandise. I share photos, blog about the hobby, and post news about upcoming figures!"

 Two desktop and two mobile pages for my fake (maybe some day real...?) website dedicated to figure collecting. Featuring my own photography of my collection. Also features my own drawings because I curl up like a bug if I don't draw for too long, and I was due.
